REvolution
==========

An experimental tool for writing regular expressions.

This tool follows .NET regular expression syntax, and support a new customer syntax, SYMBOL, which is like a regex fragment with a name.
The symbol can be writen in other regexes. The tool will automatically recognize the symbols and replace them with .NET regex.

Well, it's a little not usable, for it's just still a prototype.
In addition, the tool supports visualization of regex, you can enjoy it. :)
